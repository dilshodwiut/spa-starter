## Current limitations or bugs of this template

1. You need to install `jsdoc` globally on your machine and remove from local dependencies list to use it. Because of new approach of yarn (plug'n'play) locally installed jsdoc binary couldn't be found.
2. The script `stylelint-check` in `package.json` throws an error.
3. Depending on the requirements or project, you need to choose and install a suitable component library on your own.
4. The plopfile.cjs is not configured correctly to only have node environment in IDE, e.g. you can type `window` and the editor shows some type data
